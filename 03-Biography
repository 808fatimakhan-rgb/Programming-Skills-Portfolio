name = input("Enter your full  name: ")
hometown = input("Enter your hometown: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")  # Ask for age and make sure it's a number

# Ask for age until the user provides a valid number
while True:
 age_input = input("Enter your age: ")
 if age_input.isdigit():     # Check that the input is a number
  age = int(age_input)
  break       # Exit the loop if input is valid
 else: 
  print ("Please enter a valid number for age.")

# Step 2 : Store information in to a dictionary

biography = {
    "Name": name,
    "Age": age,
    "Hometown": hometown
}

print("Name:", biography["Name"], "\nHometown:", biography["Hometown"], "\nAge:", biography["Age"])
