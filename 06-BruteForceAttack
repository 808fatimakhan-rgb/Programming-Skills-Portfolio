# Exercise 6: Brute Force Attack
# This program allows up to 5 attempts. If the user fails 5 times,

correct_password = "12345"   # correct password (string)
max_attempts = 5             # maximum allowed attempts
attempts = 0                 # counter for attempts

# Keep asking while attempts are less than max_attempts
while attempts < max_attempts:
    user_input = input("Enter the password: ")
    attempts += 1  # increase attempt counter

    if user_input == correct_password:
        print("Access granted. Correct password entered.")
        break  # correct password, exit loop
    else:
        remaining = max_attempts - attempts
        if remaining > 0:
            print(f"Wrong password. You have {remaining} attempt(s) left.")
        else:
            # This means attempts reached max_attempts
            print("Wrong password. No attempts left.")
            print("Maximum attempts reached. Authorities have been alerted.")
