# Exercise 1: Coding is Cool
# A simple program to show items from a list and print them as a sentence.

# Create a list of words
my_list = ['Coding', 'Is', 'Cool']

# Print each word separately with a label
print('word1 =', my_list[0])  # first item in the list
print('word2 =', my_list[1])  # second item in the list
print('word3 =', my_list[2])  # third item in the list

# Print all words together in one sentence by joining them with spa
print(my_list[0] + " " + my_list[1] + " " + my_list[2])
